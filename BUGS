2022-08-05 (ops) pushed by mistak gem 0.4.10 but i had upgraded version 0.5.0 from another computer.
   2 things to do: invalidate gem 0.4.10 and also add to the make push the git pull part which ensures
   that we are not behind remote HEAD. Not sure how to do for generic UNCOMMITTED code (if all was committed,
   then just a git pull would be the easy solution..).
