    This util shall expose all Storazzo aPIs via CLI: show-local-dirs, ...
    show GCS buckets, ...

    It's also my dream to add some nice icons which are joy to the eye, like
    some  [ ] [x] before the list to show if its agood or bad directory and type also 
DESCRIPTION_HEREFILE
# >> "SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY users.id DESC"
