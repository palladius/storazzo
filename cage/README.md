What's up with this directory?

Believe me or not, googling a lot, I wasn't able to force the use by a Ruby script to use a LOCAL gem code, unless
you configure the Gemfile accordingly.

So, while developing it, I felt forced to create a small 'cage' directory with a silly Gemfile importing local Storazzo
gem and then feeding it into my bin/ code. If you teach me how to do it with a single oneliner, like

    `bundle exec --blackmagiccode bin/ricdisk-magic` 

I'll be adding you to the thanks on top README :)

Thanks again!
